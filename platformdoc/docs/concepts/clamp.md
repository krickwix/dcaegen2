# Closed Loop / CLAMP

Closed Loop is a concept where when certain conditions are observed in the network by a component, messages are sent to a particular controller that then responds to those conditions. No manual intervention is needed. Thus the 'loop' is closed automatically. Closed Loop services are configured in the CLAMP UI, which is a non-DCAE component.

There is no specific configuration in the component specification for closed loop services, and currently it is a manual process between the developer and the CLAMP support team, to discuss which configuration parameters are affected. These parameters can also be policy editable.

Refer to the [Configuration Grid](/components/component-specification/configuration-grid) for more information.
