# Service Design

Service Design is a concept where the `Service Designer` role uses the `Service Design and Creation (SDC) Tool to compose and services from available components. In doing so, the Service Designer will need to provide certain input that is required by those components.

The specific configuration that represents input that at Service Designer can provide is designated in the component specification as `designer_editable`. 

Refer to the [Configuration Grid](/components/component-specification/configuration-grid) for more information.
